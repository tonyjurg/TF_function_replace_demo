# Text-Fabric function(ality) replacement demo

This small repository contains the following two notebooks:

- [Function(ality) replacement exploration](FunctionReplacementDemo.ipynb): this demonstrates briefly various options available in Python to replace functions. It briefly indicates some pro and cons of the methods and provides reasoning on why a certain method is used (by me).

- [API instance bound replacement and additions demo](test_two_TF_datasets.ipynb): This demo clearly shows that replacing a Text-Fabric API method (like search and show in MPTF) or adding a new method (like viewtype in N1904) is strictly limited to the specific dataset it is applied to.

The purpose of this repository is to provide insight on the power and flexability of the (optional) file [app.py](https://github.com/CenterBLC/N1904/blob/main/app/app.py) that can be added to an Text-Fabric dataset.
