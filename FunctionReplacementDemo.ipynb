    "In this a custom class TfApp is created which extends the default App. Inside the `__init__ method`, types.MethodType() is used to dynamically replace the instance methods `search` and `show` with custom versions (`custom_search` and `custom_show` defined in the rest of the file). These new functions are bound directly to the instance (self), effectively overriding the original methods for that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason for using thais method is that it is NOT a global function/method replacement, but bound to an instance. That implies that it allows running multiple instances of Text-Fabric at the same time without undesired interactions between the instances.  Also I believe it to be the most transparent method that can be documented clearly in the `app.py` file. \n",
